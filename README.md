I undertook a comprehensive crime data analysis project focusing on Los Angeles from 2020 to the present. The objective was to explore crime patterns, uncover trends, and assess the impact of various socio-economic and environmental factors on crime rates. Leveraging a vast dataset, our analysis aimed to provide actionable insights for enhancing public safety and guiding policy decisions.

Project Highlights

In preparing the dataset for our Los Angeles crime analysis, I focused on meticulous data cleaning and transformation to ensure its accuracy and usability. I started by removing duplicate entries and standardizing missing values to avoid any distortions in the results. I converted time and date formats for consistency and merged columns to create meaningful addresses and consolidate crime codes. To handle empty values, I imputed median or mode values based on the type of crime, ensuring that the dataset was comprehensive and reliable for our analysis

In our exploratory data analysis, I delved into several key areas to uncover meaningful insights. I analyzed overall crime trends and discovered an 8.3% annual increase in crime rates, though the data for 2023 was skewed due to incomplete records for the last three months. I also identified seasonal patterns, noting a general decline in crime rates after summer and a rise around the New Year. By examining the most common crimes, I found that 'Stolen Vehicle' was the most prevalent, followed by 'Battery Simple Assault' and 'Identity Theft.' To streamline the analysis, I consolidated 138 original crime types into 13 broad categories

Predictive Analysis
We employed Time Series Analysis using the ARIMA model to forecast future crime rates. Our prediction indicated a likely drop in crime rates over the next three months, aligning with historical trends of decreased crime in the latter part of the year.

Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into crime patterns in Los Angeles, revealing trends influenced by seasonal changes, major events, and economic factors. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of crime dynamics and can guide policymakers and community leaders in developing targeted crime prevention strategies.
